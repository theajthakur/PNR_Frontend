            This app is designed to fetch and display Indian Railway PNR details
            in a simplified, user-friendly way. It combines the power of{" "}
            <strong>Puppeteer</strong> for browser automation and{" "}
            <strong>OCR (Optical Character Recognition)</strong> to solve
            captchas during the data scraping process.
          </p>
          <p className="card-text">
            Built with modern technologies like <strong>ReactJS</strong> for
            frontend and <strong>NodeJS</strong> for backend automation, the app
            demonstrates how automation can simulate real user interactions with
            complex systems such as IRCTC.
          </p>
          <p className="card-text">
            The app is fast, minimal, and built with Bootstrap for responsive
            UI, providing a smooth experience across devices.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted">
            Created with ðŸ’¡ and curiosity, to explore the possibilities of
            automation, OCR, and real-time data rendering.
